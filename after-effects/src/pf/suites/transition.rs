    /// AE-style Transitions can now get and set transition start and end percentages.
    /// The user can change the start and end parameters in the Effect Controls panel.
    /// To allow a plugin to be informed of changes to these values, there are two new functions in the PF TransitionSuite:
    /// [`register_transition_start_param()`](Self::register_transition_start_param) and [`register_transition_end_param()`](Self::register_transition_end_param),
    /// which register these parameters with the plugin as float parameters.
    /// Once registered, the plugin will receive [`Command::UserChangedParam`] when these params change,
    /// as well as when the transition is first applied, so the plugin can initialize them to the desired value.
    ///
    /// AE-style Transitions can now retrieve GPU frames from arbitrary locations in the underlying clips.
    /// There is a new PrGPUDependency_TransitionInputFrame, and PrGPUFilterFrameDependency has a new member to specify whether frames from the incoming or outgoing clips are needed.
    ///
    /// The call to [`register_transition_input_param()`](Self::register_transition_input_param) call must be made before the `params.add(...)` call during `param_setup`.
    ///
    /// Pass in the param to be used as the input layer for the other side of the transition.
    ///
    /// This enables your effect to be applied between two clips in the timeline just like our native transitions,
    /// but it will show up in the Effect Controls panel with full keyframable parameters similar to existing AE effects.
