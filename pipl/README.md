# `pipl`

Originating in Adobe Photoshop® over two decades ago, _Plug-In Property Lists_, or `PiPL`s, are
files that contain basic information about a plug-in's behavior, without executing the plug-in.

For archaeological reasons they are still nedeed for shipping certain plug-in types for Adobe
applications, e.g. AfterEffects® or Premiere Pro®.

This crate is a helper for creating `PiPL`s when using the `after-effects` or `premiere` crates.

Please see the README in the
[repository workspace root](https://github.com/virtualritz/after-effects) for more information.
